# Gomoku Game AI

Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is a Japanese traditional logic board game, it is played using a 19×19 board. The rules of the Gomoku game is simple and for this reason it’s a board game played mainly by children. But despite its simple rules Gomoku is a strategy and logic board game more complex and difficult than Tic Tac Toe. Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. Black plays first. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Placing so that a line of more than five stones of the same color is created does not result in a win. These are called overlines.

**Tools :** Apache NetBeans, Swing.
